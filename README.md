# MEAN Bank app
Hello everyone! This is a project I have been working on since February 2022. Through this project, I have learned about MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and NodeJs. I have also improved my JavaScript and TypeScript skills from working on this project.

## About:
MEAN Bank app (aka Angle Financial) is a banking application that is modeled after the typical banking application. When a user first reaches the site, they are greated with the global home page. From the home page, the user can login/signup for an account. Inside the account portal, users can browse/create accounts, view transactions for accounts, and make edits to their information (email, username, password, etc.).

### Features left to add:
- User information editting (change email, username, password)
- Update account balances via transactions (currently transactions are for show)
- Transaction filtering
- Account deletion
- Many more . . .

## How To Run:
1. Download the files
2. Install the node modules for each sub-project (bank-backend and bank-frontend)
3. Inside the bank-backend app run: node server.js
4. Inside the bank-fronted app run: ng serve --port 8081

## A Note About The Project:
This is for educational purposes and is not a real bank system. This is my interpretation of a bank system I created to learn full stack development.
